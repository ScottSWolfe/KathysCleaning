Java Application for Payroll and Schedule Data Entry for Kathy's Cleaning

I wrote this program as a learning process for my mother's cleaning business. I wrote this without much of an introduction to object-oriented programming and little experience with Java or other programming languages. I was inexperienced with many of the classes and features used in this application and had to spend a lot of time reading online, studying the Java documentation, stack overflow, and anywhere I could find helpful information.
