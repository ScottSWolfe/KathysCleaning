Java Application for Payroll and Schedule Data Entry for Kathy's Cleaning

I wrote this program both as a way to help myself learn Java and to help make my
 mother's weekly payroll and scheduling data entry much more efficient.
 
My father had created an Excel Template ("TemplateA.xlsx" in lib) for my mother 
to input all of her weekly payroll and scheduling data. The weekly process would
take her multiple hours. This application optimizes the process. The app is a 
GUI that allows her to enter the data much more quickly and safely due to 
various autofill features, textfield filters, convenient key traversals, and 
other features.
