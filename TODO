Things to Do


**tweak time doc filter so only allows real times** (or maybe this should be a focus listener)

create Schedule printout with place to write times worked at houses / corrections / who worked
(create app to enter all of this on mom's mobile phone??)

generate worker lists by reading excel template??

add in some headers to make what's going on more clear

make combo boxes respond to typing a name (select option that matches if match)

Build in some safety features for creating next week's schedule; For example, the user should not
be able to make an exception for someone who is not scheduled on any houses.
Also, exception blanks can be prepopulated using workers selected at houses

create a Kari's Wedding color scheme

have a way to show user that an exception has been submitted for a house panel

read from txt file into objects at beginning of program instead of straight into GUI when radio button selected? 

If write in house name (eg Sue), it autopopulates amount paid

make each day of week a slightly different color or shade of color
