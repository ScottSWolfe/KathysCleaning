Things to Do


Add some date picker to chooseweekpanel.

Add validation for bad/empty worker names throughout application.

Create save feature where user can save an incomplete report and continue it later.
Also, user can look at past reports in the app gui.

Make it so windows only open with all space in effective screen size
Eg: settings panel will open with some space hidden under windows toolbar

**tweak time doc filter so only allows real times** (or when focus shifts away..)

create Schedule printout with place to write times worked at houses / corrections / who worked

create app to enter all of this on smart phone?

generate worker lists by reading excel template

add in some headers to make what's going on more clear

make combo boxes respond to typing a name (select option that matches if match)

Build in some safety features for creating next week's schedule; For example, the user should not
be able to make an exception for someone who is not scheduled on any houses.
Also, exception blanks can be prepopulated using workers selected at houses

create a Kari's Wedding color scheme

have a way to show user that an exception has been submitted for a house panel

read from txt file into objects at beginning of program instead of straight into GUI when radio button selected? 

make each day of week a slightly different color or shade of color
