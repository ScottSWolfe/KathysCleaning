Things to Do


Next "Cards":
*Add file save and load functionality
    -directory to save files
    -develop save and load functions for each main panel
    -implement with current model (for now...), then update with new model later 
*Debug writing to excel issues on NW_SubmitWeekListener
*Add navigation menu where user can jump to different main views


Change created excel file name to be more standard (and so files will be in
chronoligical order)

Add image/icon and text to taskbar tab

Create save feature where user can save an incomplete report and continue it later.
Also, user can look at past reports in the app gui.

add code to append current text files together and save as new file when program closes

make sure changing workers in header panel changes instance variable in header
panel class (depending on this in saving state in submitWeekListener)

add ScrollPanel to Covenant Panel

move all calendar/date/day code into CalendarMethods class

Add some date picker to chooseweekpanel.

Add validation for bad/empty worker names throughout application.

Make it so windows only open with all space in effective screen size
Eg: settings panel will open with some space hidden under windows toolbar

**tweak time doc filter so only allows real times** (or when focus shifts away..)

create Schedule printout with place to write times worked at houses / corrections / who worked

create app or website to enter all of this on smart phone?

generate worker lists by reading excel template

add headers to make what's going on more clear

make combo boxes respond to typing a name (select option that matches if match)

Build in some safety features for creating next week's schedule; For example, the user should not
be able to make an exception for someone who is not scheduled on any houses.
Also, exception blanks can be prepopulated using workers selected at houses

have a way to show user that an exception has been submitted for a house panel

read from txt file into objects at beginning of program instead of straight into GUI when radio button selected? 

make each day of week and house panel a slightly different color or shade of color

change saving and loading to json objects instead of plain text
